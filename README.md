# Speedy-Slide-Creator
A fast way to create multiple slides in a google slide presentation

Create multiple slides from text content, both title slides and body text slides.

##Instructions
- Select "Add-ons>Speedy Slide Creator>Create Slides" to open the main sidebar
- select the required template(s) [see below for more detail]
- fill in the textbox with the text
- click "submit"
- Enjoy your new slides added to the end of your presentation
###How content is split
- Text will go onto a new slide when theres a new paragraph (a blank text line)
- A paragraph starting with a # (i.e. no starting spaces) will use the Title template selected
- A Title template will use the first line not starting with a # as the start of the body text for this slide. The lines before this will go in the title.

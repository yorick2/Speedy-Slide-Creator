###How your text is used?
- Text will go onto a new slide when there is a blank line
- The starting lines of a paragraph which start with a # are used for the title.
- Starting a line with a space will stop the line being seen as a title.
- If the first line doesn't starts with a #, then no title is set for that paragraph.
- Other lines are seen as body text

###Which template is used?
The template used is based on what text there given for a slide.
title only => title template
body only => body template
title + body => mixed template
